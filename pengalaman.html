            <h1>MY <span>EXPERIENCE</span></h1>
            <p>
              In 2021, I undertook an internship at PT. SHARP, where I gained valuable experience in the industrial field. During the internship, I was involved in various projects that expanded my understanding of web development and data analysis.</p>
            <p>In addition to professional experience, I am also active at the Studio Music Course. There, I developed my musical skills, particularly in solo fingerstyle guitar playing and as a bassist in the Studio Band. Additionally, I regularly enhance my singing abilities.</p>
            <p>Regarding academic skills, I am proficient in web development, web design, and data analysis. This includes a strong understanding of web technologies and the ability to analyze data accurately.</p>
            <p>As recognition of my achievements and competencies, I have received several awards and certifications, including the Musical Jazz Award in 2020 and an internship certification from PT. SHARP in 2021.</p>
